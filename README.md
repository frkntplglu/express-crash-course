# Learning Express.js

In this repository, I'm storing files that I created on my Express.js learning journey.
My main resource for that is Traverys Media Express.js Crash Course video on YouTube which was streamed on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L72fhGm1tfE&t=3531s

I will create a repository for MongoDB as well. After all, I have a plan to create a full-fledged project to consolidate my knowledge on Node, Express and MongoDB, so stay tune :)
